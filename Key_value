These are map to values, these generally are unique values are treated as blobs because as they give

an example that you can have large amount of files stored on a different story.

So this value this can be a file of this can be anything.

So generally, this are stored blobs.

No type information is stored, which means that what is the data type of this value that is not generally

preserved, sold or maintained?

Values can be heterogeneous because there is no time constraint on the value that it should be an integer

character or something, so it can be of any type.So that is the reason it can be heterogeneous.
